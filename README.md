# Multi_linear_regression
Applying the linear regression model with multiple variable as input to predict the target value in Python and R. 

There will be provided a dataset of different startups showing there investment in there different fields such as 
in research and development expense,marketing expense,administration,state and also profit for which we have to 
train our model using multiple linear regression (ax + by + cz + --- + k = p(profit)).By seeing profit we have to
guess wheather we have to invest or not in the startups.
